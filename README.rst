What is ``DMsan``?
-------------------
``DMsan`` is an open-source platform for decision-making for sanitation and resource recovery systems. It is one of a series of platforms that are being developed for the execution of QSD - a methodology for the research, design, and deployment of technologies and inform decision-making [1]_.

As an open-source multi-criteria decision analysis platform, DMsan enables users to transparently compare sanitation and resource recovery alternatives and characterize the opportunity space for early-stage technologies using multiple dimensions of sustainability with consideration of location-specific contextual parameters.

DMsan integrates with the open-source Python package `QSDsan <https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan>`_ (the quantitative sustainable design (QSD) of sanitation and resource recovery systems) for system design and simulation to calculate quantitative economic (via techno-economic analysis, TEA), environmental (via life cycle assessment, LCA), and resource recovery indicators under uncertainty [2]_.

All systems developed with QSDsan are included in the package `EXPOsan <https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan>`_ - exposition of sanitation and resource recovery systems, which can be used to develop sanitation and resource recovery alternatives for evaluation in DMsan.


Installation
------------
The easiest way is through ``pip``, in command-line interface (e.g., Anaconda prompt, terminal):

.. code::

    pip install dmsan

If you need to upgrade:

.. code::

    pip install -U dmsan

or for a specific version (replace X.X.X with the version number):

.. code::

    pip install dmsan==X.X.X

If you want to install the latest GitHub version at the `main branch <https://github.com/qsd-group/dmsan>`_ (note that you can still use the ``-U`` flag for upgrading):

.. code::

    pip install git+https://github.com/QSD-Group/DMsan.git


.. note::

   If this doesn't give you the newest ``dmsan``, try ``pip uninstall dmsan`` first.


or other fork and/or branch (replace ``<USERNAME_OF_THE_FORK>`` and ``<BRANCH_NAME>`` with the desired fork and branch names)

.. code::

    pip install git+https://github.com/<USERNAME_OF_THE_FORK>/DMsan.git@<BRANCH_NAME>


You can also download the package from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/dmsan/>`_.

Note that development of this package is currently under initial stage with limited backward compatibility, please feel free to `submit an issue <https://github.com/QSD-Group/DMsan/issues>`_ for any questions regarding package upgrading.

If you are a developer and want to contribute to ``QSDsan``, please follow the steps in the `Contributing to QSDsan <https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html>`_ section of the documentation to clone the repository. If you find yourself struggle with the installation of QSDsan/setting up the environment, this extended version of `installation instructions <https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/_installation.html>`_ might be helpful to you.


Documentation
-------------
You can find QSDsan tutorials and documents at:

   https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io

All tutorials are written using Jupyter Notebook, you can run your own Jupyter environment.

For each of these tutorials, we are also recording videos where one of the QSD group members will go through the tutorial step-by-step. We are gradually releasing these videos on our `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/@qsd-group>`_ so subscribe to receive updates!
